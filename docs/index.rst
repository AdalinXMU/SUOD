**SUOD** (**S**\calable **U**\nsupervised **O**\utlier **D**\etection) is an **acceleration framework for large-scale unsupervised outlier detector training and prediction**.
Notably, anomaly detection is often formulated as an unsupervised problem since the ground truth is expensive to acquire.
To compensate for the unstable nature of unsupervised algorithms, practitioners often build a large number of models for further combination and analysis, e.g., taking the average or majority vote.
**However, this poses scalability challenges in high-dimensional, large datasets**, especially for proximity-base models operating in Euclidean space.

**SUOD** is therefore proposed to address the challenge at three complementary levels:  random projection (**data level**), pseudo-supervised approximation (**model level**), and balanced parallel scheduling (**system level**).
As mentioned, the key focus is to **accelerate the training and prediction when a large number of anomaly detectors are presented**, while preserving the prediction capacity.
Since its inception in Jan 2019, SUOD has been successfully used in various academic researches and industry applications, include PyOD :cite:`a-zhao2019pyod` and `IQVIA <https://www.iqvia.com/>`_ medical claim analysis.


SUOD is featured for:

* **Unified APIs, detailed documentation, and examples** for the easy use.
* **Optimized performance with JIT and parallelization** when possible, using `numba <https://github.com/numba/numba>`_ and `joblib <https://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_.
* **Fully compatible with the models in PyOD**.
* **Customizable modules and flexible design**: each module may be turned on/off or totally replaced by custom functions.
